"element fit in magnetic way, or magnetic force",,,"When I looked down, I actually can't see my body.","Yeah, I think they are consistent.","although there is there, there's gaps existing there between the virtual space and it, but it did not affect my involvement of of perceiving the world as real and it VR world so so that is to say it is consistent and coherent.","Hard thieves in this virtual space in the in the and the genuine physics reality space, but the the experiences smooth so I think it's consistent in the coherence OK, It still keep me involved in that space.","because everything is so smart there, everything could have some, Feedback or like, really could be yeah","Oh yeah, i compare with the real one","yeah, definitely","similar to our reality, so i feel is good","it makes sense i dont feel weird, specially if they introduce everything at the begining, then they follow their rules","I think there are consistent, but when it comes to mechanics like this movement of taking the nails then it doesn't make much sense Or, you know, I'm just taking a book","It's not just holding something, it is opening something, and that shouldn't be as easy, you know?","That there is not, uh, consistency, because both tasks or different tasks don't don't require the I mean, they're not assisting, they're very complex that complexity on the activity so different, but everything works the same in the on the same complexity.","it's easier to do, Compared to I, I mean, I don't even need to. You know, if you want to get the thing off, you need to have really precisely stick something into it right and get the right position and you push it and also I'm thinking it.","Well, for the game probably is ok, save you time", I need to sort of do something and also let's say not really precise but I have to do something that put.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
element do not fall,,,,For with with the reality of the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,So I will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"infinity mirror effect, elements that werent real, that is new but feel real",I didn't expect. That it would mimic reality perfectly.,I expected there would be some. Sort of a more things that I don't expect. So I was open to the to the new. ,,Not assume that they will respond in a way that I can get from reality.,,,,,,,,,,,"Yeah, but they would get surprised that that something, I broke isn't really happening.","It's never scripting and if That could also give you feedback, The way you're expecting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistent,,,,"so when I think it would Be a bonus if. I tried to smash, it really smashes, because I think it's somehow like, In line with my expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, I will notice that they will not respond bound in the same way, but I will not expect that it will be like in a reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
