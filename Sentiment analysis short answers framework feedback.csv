There are a lot of things that should be in between like some of them can be real world based but partly fictional because of multi elements it might not be that straightforward 
Very awesome. In just two workshop I learned a lot about VR game.
Introduction is a little bit hard to follow at first maybe simplify the card and descriptions 
"The space for design resource is too small, hard to filled in."
"Not much, all good"
maybe the material can be more easy to understand
I feel like at the beginning we maybe need more time to think about the story.
I think no need to change
I think it’s good
no further comments
Catch users at first might be interesting to try rather than gradually develop 
It is good
I’m not very sure about the different extent of virtuality of intentional items.
I think it should be more time in the first part because it leads to the following parts.
"all good, but maybe sticker is more applicable thank using glue stick"
"The whole is very clear, and perhaps more clearly define the distinction of some labels, such as physics."
Very satisfied with this design sprint
It‘s good
Be more specific 
It is very helpful and new for me. Now I do not have any suggestion.
I feel it’s professional.
"Shorten the process of story a bit, maybe three stages will be OK."
all good
It’s good to know!
The plot part of the time is relatively small
A little bit long... 
"Perhaps try using an online collaborative board for the design, as pasting in reality is still inefficient and inconvenient to modify."
it left less time for us to structure the story.
Sometimes stickers don’t fully express what we imagine.
